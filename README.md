### Dealing with Truncated Code
When ChatGPT generates a code snippet that is too long, the output may be truncated. To prevent this, you can:

Break down the prompt into smaller, more focused tasks.
Explicitly ask ChatGPT to provide a concise solution.
Increase the max_tokens parameter, but be cautious about potential performance issues.
