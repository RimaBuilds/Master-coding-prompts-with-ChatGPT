## 1. Dealing with Truncated Code
<a name="1-dealing-with-truncated-code"></a>
**Problem:** The generated code is too long and gets cut off, and when asking ChatGPT to continue from where it stopped, it starts over instead of continuing the code. To prevent this, you can either:

- Break down the prompt into smaller, more focused tasks.
- Explicitly ask ChatGPT to provide a concise solution.
- Increase the max_tokens parameter, but be cautious about potential performance issues.

**Perfect Prompt:**

```markdown
ChatGPT, your answer got truncated. Please continue the previously generated code without repeating any part of it. The last part of the previous code snippet was:

<Insert the last few lines of the generated code here>

Continue generating the remaining code from this point onwards, ensuring that the solution picks up where it left off and does not start over.'''
